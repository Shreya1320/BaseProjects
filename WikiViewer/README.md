# The WikiViewer
#### Project made for the old freeCodeCamp curriculum

This is a project made for the old curriculum on FreeCodeCamp which required the camper to code a Wikipedia Viewer. I made it using Vue 2.

This is how it looks like.

#### User Stories

These are the requirements for this project. They are all fullfilled.

1. I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
2. I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

Hints:
1. Here's a URL you can use to get a random Wikipedia article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random.
2. Here's an entry on using Wikipedia's API: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page.
3. Use this link to experiment with Wikipedia's API.
