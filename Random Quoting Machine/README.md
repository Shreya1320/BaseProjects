9. My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.
